E-COMMERCE DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  
In the fast-paced digital era, electronic commerce (e-commerce) has become an integral part of the global economy, transforming the way businesses operate and consumers engage in transactions. The success of any e-commerce platform relies heavily on an efficient and robust Database Management System (DBMS) to handle the vast amounts of data generated by online transactions, user interactions, and inventory management. 
Our project's primary objective is to create a scalable and secure platform that facilitates seamless interactions between customers, products, orders, and the overall E-commerce ecosystem. By utilizing AWS as our cloud infrastructure provider, we aim to harness the power of cloud computing to ensure reliability, scalability, and global accessibility for our Ecommerce platform.
